I have installed <span style="font-weight: bold;">AVG Free</span> as anti-virus software on my laptop. I think they are quite good. Although it is quite safe, sometime I will use other online virus checker to scan my computer to ensure my computer is secure.

I used to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trend Micro HouseCall </span>to do a online scan on my computer, sometime it did find some Trojan and worms, but AVG did not notice it. But as soon as I upgrade my laptop to Windows Vista, HouseCall did not work again. On the previous version of HouseCall it did say it does not support Windows Vista. When I check it again today, it said it did now.

My computer has not done any full virus scan for quite awhile, I think I should have a try now. I am not sure if it is something not quite right on my computer. I cannot get it work on my IE, it said "<span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">HouseCall is not available for your platform</span></span>"&#8230;"<span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 85%;">You can not use Trend Micro HouseCall on your machine because your processor type or your operating system are not supported.</span>" etc. (but on the front page, they did say they support vista and IE6 or above). I hope it is not something to do with my CPU which is “Centrino Duo
”.

When i try again on Firefox, it seems to work. The different is I need to download an exe file instead of running it directly on browser(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Firefox</span>).

After I downloaded the "housecall66.exe" I just double click on it to execute it.

When you started it, it will ask you to accept the <span style="font-weight: bold;">terms and condition</span> agreement.

Once you done that you need to choose a <span style="font-weight: bold;">HouseCall Kernel</span> which his either a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brower base</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Java base</span>. Then you would need to download the plug-in, it may take awhile.
(I chose Browser Base)

Then you will see a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Select Scan Options</span>" screen.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Recommended scan</span> &#8211; only scan for malware, grayware, vulnerability and selected location. It will perform quicker

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Complete scan</span> &#8211; probably will scan for everything on you PC

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Customized Scan</span> &#8211; you can select what to scan.
It has one more option than Recommended Scan which is scan open network port
I think it would be quite useful to see if your computer has open a network port which could be attack by hacker.
If you have selected "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open Network ports</span>" it will pop up a message to inform you that the program will perform a port scan. (It is not a hacker attack (not this time))

It takes about 4 hours to scan my computer, which has 160GB HDD, filled in around 110GB data
