I have updated **Milestone to Android 2.1** few days ago. This is how I felt after the upgrade.  
**Live wallpaper support**  
&#8211; This is a very cool feature, which allow you to select **animated/interactive wallpaper**. It looks beautiful, and make me feel more relax when I look at that Live Wallpaper[I have chosen &#8220;**Grass**&#8220;, which will change depend on the time of the date]. You can also choose **Map**(an Interactive **Google Map**, but you have to ensure you have internet access, otherwise the map cannot be show) as your **Live Wallpaper**.

**Configurable multi home screen panels (up to 9 screens)**  
After upgraded to 2.1. It has increased the Home screen panels to 5 screens, which make it easier for me to use different screen to group different applications together [E.g. A screen for games, widget like **Google finance**]. However, I have no idea where to configure to have 9 screens. Fortunately, when I try to change the &#8220;Brightness&#8221; of the screen, I saw a new list item which is &#8220;**Number of home panels**&#8220;. Inside &#8220;Number of home panels&#8221; you can configure you mobile to have **3,5,7,9** panels on your home screen.

If you could not find where to configure **multi home screen panels**, you can try the following:  
&#8220;**Settings**&#8220;&#8211;>&#8221;**Sound & display**&#8221; &#8211;>&#8221;**Number of home panels**&#8220;

Hope you find it useful.
