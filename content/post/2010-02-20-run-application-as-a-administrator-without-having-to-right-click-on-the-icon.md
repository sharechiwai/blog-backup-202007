<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:16px;">My friend at work has show me a trick on Windows Vista and Windows 7, about how to run the application as Administrator [<b>Run as administrator</b>] without the need on right click on the application icon and click on [<b>Run as administrator</b>], which is quick and handy.</span>

<div style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
  I use command prompt for scan disk once every two week. I always run it by entering &#8220;cmd&#8221; on the search text box [<b>Search programs or file</b>s], after &#8220;<b>cmd</b>&#8221; is appeared, I would need to right click and select &#8220;<b>Run as administrator</b>&#8221; so that I can use the &#8220;<b>chkdsk /f</b>&#8221; command [scan disk and try to fix disk error?]. Otherwise it will tell you, you do not have the right to execute this command&#8230;something like that.

</div>

<div style="margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;">
  1) After you entered the application name on the search text box, instead of pressing &#8220;<b>Enter</b>&#8221; key, you can press &#8220;<b>CTRL </b>+ <b>SHIFT </b>+ <b>ENTER</b>&#8220;<br />2) If you are are choosing the application from the &#8220;Start Menu&#8221; you can also hold down &#8220;<b>CTRL </b>+ <b>SHIFT</b>&#8221; and click on the application you want to &#8220;<b>Run as administrator</b>&#8220;.
