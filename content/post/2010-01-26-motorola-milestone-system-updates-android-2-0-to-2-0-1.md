I am glad that we can now upgrade the OS from android 2.0 to 2.0.1.  
It said on this update, it improved the following.

  * OS stability is improved.
  * Battery life is improved.  <&#8211; [by dimming the background light (I think)]
  * Camera auto focus functionality is improved
  * Update the Lock Screen
  * Enhance Bluetooth performance
  * Add the 3D Audio Effects
  * Add World Clock Widget

The update progress is quite smooth, it takes 5- 10 mins to download the update and only takes about a minute to update the system. It has updated some application icon and added an application called Audio effects, which allow you to update the Equalizer mode e.g. Extremebass, Bass punch, Balanced &#8230;etc.  
Overall, I am quite happy with this update =)
