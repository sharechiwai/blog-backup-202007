Today my friend need to launch my Windows application via his windows application.  
Our application are both on a server.

To archieve that what we need to do is to use **Process.Start()** method

**Diagnostics.Process.Start(**full file path and name**)**  
E.g.  
VB  
<span style="color:rgb(0,153,0);font-size:85%;"><strong>Diagnostics.Process.Start(&#8220;C:Program FilesInternet Explorer.exe&#8221;)</strong></span>

C#  
<span style="color:rgb(0,153,0);font-size:85%;"><strong>Diagnostics.Process.Start(@&#8221;C:Program FilesInternet Explorer.exe&#8221;);</strong></span>

After you done that you should be able to launch/open the file by clicking on a button&#8230;etc

Good luck
