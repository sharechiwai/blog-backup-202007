今日當我嘗試在我個網誌查看statistic 時 出現了這個Error message

&#8220;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Your WordPress.com account, [username] is not authorized to view the stats of this blog. Currently access to stats is broken for some users and we are working on fixing this.

[<img class="alignnone" title="Your WordPress.com account, username is not authorized to view the stats of this blog.

幸好..都只是用這個account 來查看有多小人來看這個網誌和看看那一篇網誌比較受歡迎&#8230;etc

不知道什麼時間才會解決這個問題呢&#8230;還是希望快點可以看看不同blog 的statistic =P
