In there few days, I have a strong feeling which I can upgrade the **Milestones** Operating System to **Android 2.1**. I guess it is because my friend told me his **HTC Tattoo** will be able to upgrade to Android 2.1 soon, at the moment I wish I has **Tattoo** instead of **Milestone** which is a lot cheaper and it also have some feature that I want but it is not avaliable on Milestone yet.

I hope this release will fix several issue. E.g. BlueTooth still does not work on all device, Sometime it crash when you playing music.[You cannot pause/stop the music after the screen lock], when the keyboard is opened, you cannot use the **Compass**.

**In this update, they said they have enhances the performance in various perspectives**

  1. Live wallpaper support 
  2. Configurable multi home screen panels (up to 9 screens) <span style="color:#38761d;"><&#8211; I am not sure how to get 9 screens, I have only find 5 at the moment.</span>
  3. Voice Dialer app (English for HK)<span style="color:#38761d;"><&#8211; Seems to work well</span>
  4. Motorola Camera app <span style="color:#38761d;"><&#8211; They have splited the camera app into 2 now. One for phone another one for video, They have also changed the UI, which may take time to get used to.</span>
  5. Facebook app 
  6. HelpCenter app <span style="color:#38761d;"><&#8211; this app is a bit pointless, What it does is create some button on the app, which will link to a webpage for user guide/ tutorial about how to use Milestone.</span>
  7. Quickoffice app (viewer only)
  8. Moto Car Home app 
  9. Additional languages support (Dutch, Portuguese, Greek, Polish, Turkish)  <span style="color:#38761d;"><&#8211;Unfortunately, it still does not support Chinese. it would be great to have chinese input ChangJie, T9 for the chinese input method like HTC/Acer.</span>

The update process is very smooth which is same as before. Overall, I think this update did improve the user experience of using this mobile quite a lot. Do you agree?
