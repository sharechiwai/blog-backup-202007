A friend of mine, has received an error message after he scan virus. The error messages is:  
&#8220;**could not find the file flash.ocx**&#8220;

Actually, I have seen the same message few years ago on my previous laptop. I have managed to solve that issue.

**Here it is my solutions.**  
1) Go to the following location:  
**C:WindowsSystem32MacromedFlash**  
It should contains some files which is end with &#8220;**.ocx**&#8221; E.g. **Flash10e.ocx**  
2) make a copy of that file. In my case &#8220;**Flash9c.ocx**&#8221; and rename it to &#8220;**flash.ocx**&#8220;

This should fix this issue. 

Good Luck
