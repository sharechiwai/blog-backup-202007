I am working on a application, which need to consume a web-service which is provided by another company. When I try to make a **Web-service request/<span class="goog-spellcheck-word" style="background:none repeat scroll 0 0 yellow;">RPC</span>** call, I have received a **timeout exception** from my application.  
&#8220;<span style="color:red;font-size:x-small;"><b>The request channel timed out while waiting for a reply after 00:00:57.6118634.

I guess, it is something to do with their web-service, E.g. the web service did not work properly and it used to work in **Visual Studio 2005** [I am using **Visual Studio 2008** for this application]. When I check the application <span class="goog-spellcheck-word" style="background:none repeat scroll 0 0 yellow;">config</span> file. I have found something interesting, which is related with timeout. Then I have figured out what is causing the **timeout exception**. =).

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;">
  <a href="https://i0.wp.com/oldblog.sharechiwai.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wstimeout0100.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="https://i0.wp.com/oldblog.sharechiwai.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wstimeout0100.png?resize=625%2C267" width="625" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

**Here it is my solution:**  
To resolve the **timeout exception**, you can simply increase the timeout value to a appropriate time, which will not affect the performance of your application. E.g. If you set the timeout value too high, when the web-service do gone down, your application will waste lots of time, because it think the web-service is doing something.

For my application, I have updated the timeout value to 3 minutes which is **00:03:00**. [**<span class="goog-spellcheck-word" style="background:none repeat scroll 0 0 yellow;">hh</span><span style="background-color:yellow;">:mm:</span><span class="goog-spellcheck-word" style="background:none repeat scroll 0 0 yellow;">ss</span>**].

Hope you find it useful. =)
