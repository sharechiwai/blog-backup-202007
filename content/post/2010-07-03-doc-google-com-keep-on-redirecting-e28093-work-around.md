Since few months ago, when I try to go to my **Google Document** via [http://doc.google.com](http://doc.google.com/), the browser will keep on redirecting me to the authenticate page. However this page just has a **redirect loop**. I have tried on different browser, and some other method which people suggested. Like Clear Browser History/cookies..etc. The result is the same.

Finally, I have worked out how to get around it and go to my **Google Document** without having the redirect loop problem.

**Here it is the solution:**  
Instead of going to **Google Document** via [http://doc.google.com](http://doc.google.com/) you can use:  
[http://docs.google.com](http://docs.google.com/) use **docs** instead of **doc**.

Hope you find it useful.
