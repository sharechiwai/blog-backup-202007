When I login to MSDN today, I found that Office 2010 is available for us to download. However, when you go the the official website, it still saying you can download the beta version. [www.microsoft.com/office/2010/en/default.aspx](http://www.microsoft.com/office/2010/en/default.aspx%20)  
Anyway **Office 2010 RTM** has been released on 22nd April 2010 to MSDN subscriber. Microsoft will launch it to everyone on 12th May 2010. I am quite interested to try out what is the different between **Office 2010** and **Office 2007**, would it be a lot smoother and consume less resource or would it be change a lot &#8230;etc.

For more information, feel free to visit the URL below for **Office2010 and SharePint 2010 Launch Event**.
