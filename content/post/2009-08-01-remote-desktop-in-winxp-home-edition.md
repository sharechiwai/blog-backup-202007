<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px;">I was trying to use &#8220;<strong>Remote Desktop Connection</strong>&#8221; to connect to work place via <strong>VPN</strong>, because it is a lot quicker/smoother then using VNC client. Unfortunately, I cannot find the program under &#8220;<strong>Start</strong>&#8221; -> &#8220;<strong>All Program</strong>&#8221; -> &#8220;<strong>Accessories</strong>&#8221; from my WinXP Home edition laptop. Then, I was recommended to download the third party software. = (</span>

However, I found out that we have option for it. If you don&#8217;t want to download the software. May be you can try to type &#8220;**MSTSC**&#8221; from &#8220;**Start**&#8221; ->&#8221;**Run**&#8220;. The remote desktop console should appear. If not, then you can try to download the software from :
