Finally,I have create another **Silverlight application**, which allow me to use the **Google Language API** and **Microsoft Translator API** together. So that we can compare which translator do better job.

In my opinion, **Google Translate** is a lot more powerful than **Microsoft Translator,** as the Google Translate can translate a lot more language then Microsoft one. On the other hand, Google Translate has ability to detect the input language, which is more convenient.

If you try to translate &#8220;**bill gate**&#8221; [All in lowercase] but using the application below, you will realise the different between two translator.

I would be grateful, if you could give me some suggestion on how to make this mini application better.
