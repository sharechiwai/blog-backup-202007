Sometime you may find it useful to de-select an Item on ComboBox,  
when you try to force a user to pick one from the list.

Here it is the code sample to deselect a selected item on ComboBox in Silverlight.  
[Just need to set the selected Index to -1]  
[vb]  
ComboBox1.SelectedIndex=-1  
[/vb]  
Hope you find it useful.
