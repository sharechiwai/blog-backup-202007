Just found a very useful link for **Visual Studio 2010**, that allow you to download the **Visual Studio 2010** Keyboard Shortcut for **C++**, **C#**, **F#** and **VB**.

Here it is the download website [Visual Studio 2010 Keybinding Cards](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=92ced922-d505-457a-8c9c-84036160639f)

It is good to know some of the shortcut in Visual Studio.  
E.g. When you are developing a website, you can use &#8220;**Ctrl + K**&#8221; + &#8220;**Ctrl + D**&#8221; to format the code on the current document you can also use &#8220;**Ctrl + K**&#8221; + &#8220;**Ctrl + F**&#8221; to format the selected code.

one thing bother me a lot is the &#8220;**Undo**&#8221; shortcut which I though it should be &#8220;**Ctrl + Y**&#8221; [which is most of the application do] However in Visual Studio, it is &#8220;**Ctrl + Shift + Z**&#8220;&#8230;

Hope you find it useful.
