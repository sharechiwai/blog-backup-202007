Just created a mini maths game, which contains 20 simple maths question. See how long will it take you to answer them correctly. You can select the level of difficulty from the drop down list. You can also choose what kind of question you want to have, E.g. +/- only by ticking the checkbox.

Hope you would enjoy the game. I would be grateful, if you could give me some feedback/suggestion of this mini game. =)
