  I started to receive the Text message below:
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&#8220;Inbox Full: Text message waiting. Inbox full. You may wish to delete some old messages.&#8221;<br /> </strong></span>
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  On my mobile <strong>[Motorola Milestone</strong>] since last Friday. I followed the advise to delete some <strong>SMS </strong>from my mobile and the <strong>SIM </strong>card. However. I still keep on receiving the message&#8230; every hour&#8230;
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  After doing some research online, and I try it out myself.
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  <strong>You can try the following step:</strong>
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  1)    Check if the internal memory of your mobile is running low. [My mobile still has 15MB free space]
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  as soon as I uninstalled some application to free up some space. I am able to receive Email again =)
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  2)    If possible try to put your SIM card to other mobile phone see if you can receive SMS on the other mobile.
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  if not you can go to the Mobile network provider ask for a replacement SIM card, if looks like your SIM card is failure.
</div>

<div id="_mcePaste">
  3)    Try to do a &#8220;<strong>Factory data reset</strong>&#8221; -> It will erase all the data on the phone. If it still does not work, I would suggest you send your mobile to the company, see if there anything wrong on your mobile.
