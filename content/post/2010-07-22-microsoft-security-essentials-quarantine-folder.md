My friend has asked where could we find the **Quarantine folder for Microsoft Security** Essentials. He is interest to see what it looks like and what will happen if he opens the folder.

After doing some research online I found the path finally:  
**In Windows XP:**  
<span style="color:#008000;">C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication DataMicrosoftMicrosoft AntimalwareQuarantine</span>

**In Windows Vista / Windows 7**

<span style="color:#008000;">C:ProgramDataMicrosoftMicrosoft AntimalwareQuarantine</span>

You may need to enabled your computer to view hidden file in order to view the Quarantine folder.

Hope you find it useful =)
