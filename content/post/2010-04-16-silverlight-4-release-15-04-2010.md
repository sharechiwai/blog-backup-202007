**Silverlight 4** has released finally. When I went to M**icrosoft MIX 2010**. They show us lots of cool features and stuff that you can do on **Silverlight 4**. Hope I can have some spare time to develop some cool stuff in Silverlight. 

Just find a annoying thing on **Silverlight 4** release.  
All the application that I developed via **Silverlight Beta/RC** is not working anymore [I guess it probably happen to most of the developer, who has developed some application by using the beta/RC version of **SilverLight 4**]  
When I load up my blog today. The following message pop-up.

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;">
  <a href="https://i0.wp.com/oldblog.sharechiwai.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/silverlightwarning.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="151" src="https://i0.wp.com/oldblog.sharechiwai.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/silverlightwarning.png?resize=400%2C151" width="400" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
</div>

I would need to recompile all the application that I created before by using the RC/Beta version. In order to get it works again.

Hope I can upgrade all my app this weekend. =)
