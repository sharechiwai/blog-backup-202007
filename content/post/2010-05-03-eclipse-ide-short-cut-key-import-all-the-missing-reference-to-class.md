Have been using **Eclipse** and try to develop some **Android application** for fun. However, I find it a bit difficult that you need to import a lot of reference onto the class whenever you added/reference a new type Android control on E.g. View, TextView, EditText, Button. 

Luckily, my friend has show me a short-cut key that I can use to make my develpment life a bit easier.

To import all the missing reference to the class.  
You can try:  
&#8220;**Ctrl**&#8221; + &#8220;**Shift**&#8221; +&#8221;**o**&#8220;

Hope you find it useful!

Happy programming
