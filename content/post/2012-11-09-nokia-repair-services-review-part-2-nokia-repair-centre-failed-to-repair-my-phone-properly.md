After receiving the repaired phone from **Nokia Repair Centre** , I unboxed **8th Nov 2012** it and tried to switch on to check if it was working. My **Nokia Lumia 800** switched on and I was surprised to see that the phone had not been erased as all my **data**/**picture**/**videos** were still there. However the battery level was very very low.

I decided to **back-up** my data, just in case if there were any problems on the phone, then I still had the most up-to-date **data/pictures/videos**. I started by connecting the **Nokia Lumia 800** to my PC. However, after plugging it in I receive a message saying &#8220;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned. Windows does not recognize it</strong></span>.&#8221;. I was wondering if it was something to do with the PC, however unfortunately, it was not.

I tried several PC’s which had **Microsoft Zune** installed, and none of them recognised my repaired phone, but did recognise other **Nokia Lumia 800**’s and a **Samsung Omnia 7**. And also rather than taking 2-4 hours to fully charge the phone took around 6-8 hours. I suspected that the USB connection was broken on the phone, which may cause this type of problem.

I have contacted **Nokia Care team** again and filled in the **Online feedback form** regarding the repair, hope they will reply me soon to arrange another collection and to do a test on the device to ensure everything works properly, as I can imagine, they would need to collect the phone and repair it again, which will take at least 4 days in total.

However, Nokia Care Escalation Team contacted me in the evening the date **9th Nov 2012** after I email them and gave them feedback, and tweet them.  
At the point, I will **rate 5/10** of **Nokia Repair Service**. I am very disappointed of the quality of **Nokia Repair Centre**. As I felt they [**Nokia Repair Centre**] are not professional, as on the letter which come with the repair phone did not state which part of the phone failure to cause the phone did not start up at all and it doesn’t have any information if the repair has passed the **QA**. I am not sure if they have any test tools which allow them to diagnose the phone and to check if it has any other hardware/software issue. The **Nokia Care team** seems to take long time to reply email. The best way I would suggest if you have the same issue is.. .to use **twitter** to escalate your issue&#8230;
