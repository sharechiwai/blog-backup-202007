When i try to upgrade one of my application at work today from VS2005 to VS2008 I have received the following error. 

<div style="color:red;">
  <span class="Apple-style-span"><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:small;">&#8220;BadImageFormatException was unhandled&#8221;</span></b></span>
</div>

<span style="font-size:x-small;"><b><span style="color:red;">Could not load file or assembly &#8216;xxx&#8217;, Version = x.x.x.x, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null&#8217; or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrent format</span></b></span>

This error is caused by one of the library, i created 1.5 years ago, which is a helper class for crystal report 11 R2 (from VS2005). I am quite worry this library if it is not going to work on any newer version of VS / .NET. Because of different version of .Net Framework!?

Fortunately, I remember that,I have some issue with 64bits windows before with SSIS and on another application that I created. It would be a good try to compile this application in 32 bit.

Here it is my solutions.

1) On Visual Studio Open &#8220;**My Project**&#8221; from the &#8220;**Solution Explorer**&#8220;  
2) Click on the &#8220;**Compile**&#8221; Tab  
3) Then Click on &#8220;**Advanced Compile Options&#8230;**&#8220;  
Select &#8220;**Advanced Compiler Setting**s&#8221; -> Update Target CPU property to &#8220;**x86**&#8221; instead of &#8220;**Any CPU**&#8220;

I guess this error occurs is because the library that i created/Compiled is on a 32 bits windows. Now i am using a 64 bits machines. When I run the application i throw that error.

Hope you find it useful.
