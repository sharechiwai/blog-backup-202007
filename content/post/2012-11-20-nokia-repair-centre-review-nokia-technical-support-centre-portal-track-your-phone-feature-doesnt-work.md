Today I just realise, **Nokia Technical Support Centre** website has &#8220;**Track Your Phone**&#8221; feature, which allow user to track the repair status of your phone. All you need to do is to provide your **Postcode** and **Customer Reference Number**.

After fill in all the necessary information and click on &#8220;**Search**&#8220;, it will show you all the information related with the repair status related with the provided **Customer Reference Number**, it also has a very nice interface to show you the status, E.G. &#8220;**Online Booking made**&#8220;, &#8220;**Received at Nokia**&#8220;, &#8220;**In Repair Centre**&#8220;, &#8220;**On way back to you**&#8220;. As well as &#8220;**Job log**&#8220;. E.g. what has been done&#8230;etc.

However, the information doesn&#8217;t seem to get update frequently, as I have received an email from **Nokia Repair Centre** yesterday **19th Nov 2012** said: &#8220;_<span style="color: #000080;">Hi Chi,</span>_

_<span style="color: #000080;">Just to let you know that your Nokia 800 (Lumia) Black has now arrived at the Repair Centre and will be assessed by an engineer shortly.</span>_

_<span style="color: #000080;">We will continue to email you with status updates throughout the repair process.</span>_”  
But up until now **20th Nov 2012** on the &#8220;**Track Your Phone&#8221;** page, it shown that it is still on &#8220;**Online booking made**&#8221; stage, not even on &#8220;**Received at Nokia yet**&#8220;.  
<img src="http://api.photoshop.com/v1.0/accounts/aa9037104a014abbb11ad4bd58324b91/assets/25fab08ba6df4af1902d79c1d3b6679b" alt="Nokia Repair Centre Job Summary" width="967" height="522" />  
I hope **Nokia** could resolve this issue, so that customer could make use of this portal.

Wish me Luck
