I have received a task to convert the project handbook from Word Document into Crystal report. It does not sound difficult until I need to do some formatting and Layout.

I had a problem on trying to make a field to display in Multi-line, instead of one line. And I am not able to file a word wrap function on Crystal Report. After spending some time on the web. Finally I find out how to do it.

**Solution:**

1) **Select** the **field(s)** that you want to enable WordWrap.

2) Right click and select &#8220;**Format Field**&#8221; OR **&#8220;Format Objects&#8221;** (if you select more than 1 fields)

3) Then in the **&#8220;Format Editor&#8221;** Click on the **&#8220;Common&#8221;** tab.

4) You will see the screen shot similar as below.

[<img title="Crystal Reports fields Format Editor" src="https://i1.wp.com/api.photoshop.com/home_453edadf42c44e2bba351fb5d2dfaeb1/adobe-px-thumbnails/fe5dd095128d47e39605022d415e78d6/256.jpg?resize=412%2C512" alt="Crystal Reports fields Format Editor" width="412" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i1.wp.com/api.photoshop.com/home_453edadf42c44e2bba351fb5d2dfaeb1/adobe-px-thumbnails/fe5dd095128d47e39605022d415e78d6/256.jpg)

5) Then **&#8220;Tick&#8221;** the **&#8220;Can Grow&#8221;** check box and click **&#8220;OK&#8221;</p> 

</strong>6)After you done that you can save the Report and press **&#8220;F5&#8221;** to preview the report.

Hopefully you the field will be wrapped into next line.

Good luck
