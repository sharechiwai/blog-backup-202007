Today my friend has asked me a good question, he want to ensure the data on the **DataGridView** is in the correct sorting order. He is wondering how to achieve that. I still remember, I have tried something similar before. 

Here it is what you need to do:  
E.G. 

  1. We have a **DataGridView** called &#8220;**dgv_Membership**&#8220;
  2. This table contains &#8220;**Surname**&#8220;, &#8220;**First Name**&#8220;, &#8220;**DoB**&#8220;, &#8220;**Screen name**&#8220;
  3. We would like to sort the table by **DoB (Date Of Birth)** before we process that data.

What we need to do it to use the Sort method on the **DataGridView** control  
<span style="font-size:x-small;"><b>dgv_Membership.Sort(dgv_Membership.Columns(&#8220;Dob&#8221;),System.ComponentModel.ListSortDirection.Ascending )</b></span>

**Explanation**:  
**GridViewName.Sort(&#8220;GridViewColumn that you want to sort by&#8221;, &#8220;Sorting Direction&#8221;)**

Good Luck
